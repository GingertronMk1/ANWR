\section*{Profile}
I am a second year Computer Science student studying for my MSc at the University of Nottingham.
I have skills transferable to the workplace which include team working, effective communication, time management, adaptability, determination, and being able to take direction.

As well as working towards my degree I am also a member of a number of societies, including Improv, Radio, TEC, Film, and Pool\\
\\
With the Improv Society I have gained valuable experience speaking in front of large groups of people.
I successfully auditioned to be part of a small troupe of 6 people, and spent 9 months planning and preparing for a show we took to Edinburgh Fringe 2016.
I feel this honed my organisational skills, taught me how to take direction and constructive criticism and showed determination to make the show work.
I also find active listening a useful skill in group work.
Within this society I was also elected Publicity and Media Secretary.
I like that you have to make decisions quickly and work as part of a team.\\
\\
With the Radio Society I have organised my own radio shows for the university radio station, utilising skills of time management, adaptability and also working around a theme.\\
\\
With the TEC society, which is about sound, lights and stage sets for events both inside and away from the university,
I was personally involved in setting the sound system for a nationally televised badminton competition as well as a number of small events within the university as well as the students union election night.
From this I gained an insight into Health and Safety and working for others.\\
\\
During the summer of 2014 I volunteered at the Centre for Digital Innovation in Hull (C4DI).
Whilst there my project, together with a colleague, was to research the concept of smart cities in other countries and how their technologies could work in Hull, City of Culture 2017.
This culminated in producing and presenting a slide show presentation for the bosses of the C4DI, the information from which was going to be presented to the local council.
Whilst there I also developed a website for one of the founders of the C4DI.\\

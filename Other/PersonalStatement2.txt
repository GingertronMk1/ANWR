    Computers are fantastic tools. 

    Over the summer I had an internship at the Center for Digital Innovation in Hull, which
helped me understand a number of the skills needed to work well in a development environment.
I was tasked with creating a website to which people could upload geotagged images and have them
appear on a map. I had to learn the skills from scratch, including all the necessary languages, as
well as working around problems involved in the process (such as converting DMS coordinates into
decimalised degrees).

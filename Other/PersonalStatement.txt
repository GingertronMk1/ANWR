    Computer Science fascinates me, as everything is run by computers these days and
I'd like to know how they work. The way computers are programmed and the
thinking required to make them do even simple things is something I would like
to study and continue with.

    My current academic choices are a result of my liking to know how things
work, and I feel a good grounding in those subjects lends itself to being able
to come up with realistic programs. It helps that I find them interesting, as
like most people, I do the best work in subjects in which I'm interested.

    Over the summer I had an internship at the C4DI in Hull, during which I created
a website that allows people to upload pictures and be presented with a
geographical map of those pictures. I had to learn and implement all of the necessary skills
to do so myself, as well as coming up with functions to help me in this task and
setting up the front and back end. I also had to learn how to use Vim, which I think warrants a special mention of
its own.

    I also attend monthly Arduino meetups, where challenges are set, and I find it fun
to try to complete them in as few lins of code as possible. I've gone through
Codecademy courses on Python, HTML & CSS, PHP, and JavaScript, which have given
me a good base to work from in terms of learning other languages.

    To summarise, I like computers. I like telling them to do things that would
take a human a week and watching them do it in a second. I like understanding
how they work, and trying to guess at the bits I don't understand. And I don't
think I know enough about them.

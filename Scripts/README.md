# Scripts

- `BackupMusic.sh` - backs music up to my Raspberry Pi.
- `ConvertAndTidy.sh` - takes all `.m4a` files in a folder (looking recursively), converts them to `.mp3`, then reorganises them by Album Artist then Album. It can also do either of the above two things by themselves.
- `MacOS.sh` - Terminal settings for if I get a new Mac or this one goes wobbly and I've to reset it.
- `NewPackages.sh` - on a new Debian systems, install all the things I use regularly.
- `convert2mp3.sh` - see `ConvertAndTidy.sh`, but without the tidy bit.
- `mp3copy.sh` - basically rsync but via a conversion to `.mp3`.

# Jack's Dotfiles

I'm a Computer Science student, I feel I need a dotfiles repo somewhere. So here it is!

### Non-Dotfiles (I know it's called a dotfile repo, shush)
* MacOS.sh: a shell script that sets sensible defaults on a Mac. Quite why I made this I don't know, as I'm probably not going to get a new Mac for a very long time...
* newSystem.sh: a shell script that points files in the right direction on a new system.

### Dotfiles (Yes, there are also dotfiles, so the repo's not that bad)
* .aliases: where my aliases live (there's a few of them)
* .bash_profile: the meat of the dotfiles. Lots of config here.
* .bashrc: I'm certain there's something better I could do with this, but as it stands it just points to bash_profile.
* .exports: all the things I want exported, mostly related to bash history config
* .functions: functions, really. I've only got the four at the moment, but they still might clutter up the bash_profile.
* .gitconfig: there's probably some security issue with me posting my gitconfig here, but oh well. I don't think it stores passwords, and if it did, I'm pretty certain I'd hear about it before anyone nicked anything.
* .inputrc: macOS doesn't seem to want to tab-complete, so this is here.
* .prompt: my PS1 and PS2 prompts. PSes 3 and 4 I don't know or care enough about to set.
* .vimrc: my first dotfile, the basis for all my editing. Bane of one of my mates who's used to vanilla vim.
* .xsessionrc: makes Debian play nice with ThinkPads and their nipple mice.

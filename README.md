# Jack's Odds and Sods

I'm a Computer Science student, I feel I need a dotfiles repo somewhere. So here it is!

- `/Dotfiles`: Config Files
- `./vim`: For Vim colours and skeleton files
- `.hushlogin`: makes Debian systems shut up when I log in.
- `NewSystem.sh`: a shell script that points files in the right direction on a new system.
- `README.md`: you're reading it.

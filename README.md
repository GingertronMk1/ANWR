Assot
=====

To be used for random text storage (.vimrc and /r/DailyProgrammer challenges mostly)

It's called Assot because I went on a random word generator to choose a game
engine name on Game Dev Tycoon and Assot was memorable. Apparently it's defined
as 'to infatuate', so take that for what you will.

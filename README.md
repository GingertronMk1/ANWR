Dotfiles repo, cos every good CS student needs one.

* .bashrc:        Self-explanatory  
* .inputrc:       Makes Mac Terminal tab-complete  
* .vimrc:         Self-explanatory  
* .xsessionrc:    Makes Debian play nice with ThinkPad nipple mice and buttons  
* molokai.vim:    My preferred Git colour scheme  
* newDebian.sh:   A shell script I can run when I get a new Debian system. As part of it it installs Git, so I think I may have to think about this some more.

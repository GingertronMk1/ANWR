# Jack's Odds and Sods

I'm a Computer Science student, I feel I need a dotfiles repo somewhere. So here it is!

- `NewSystem.sh`: a shell script that points files in the right direction on a new system.
- `.hushlogin`: makes Debian systems shut up when I log in.
- `README.md`: you're reading it.
- `/Dotfiles`: Config Files
- `/Other`: Other Coding Things That Don't Belong Anywhere Else
- `/Scripts`: General-Purpose Scripts
- `/vimcolors`: Needs Its Own Folder Because Reasons

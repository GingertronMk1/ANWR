Jack's Dotfiles
===============

I'm a Computer Science student, I feel I need a dotfiles repo somewhere. So here it is!

* newSystem.sh: a shell script that points files in the right direction on a new system.
* .aliases: where my aliases live (there's a few of them)
* .bash_profile: the meat of the dotfiles. Lots of config here.
* .bashrc: I'm certain there's something better I cold do with this, but as it stands it just points to bash_profile.
* .inputrc: macOS doesn't seem to want to tab-complete, so this is here.
* .macos: the file I'm least sure about. I guess it does some Mac-specific config, I don't know what to do with it.
* .vimrc: my first dotfile, the basis for all my editing. Bane of one of my mates who's used to vanilla vim.
* .xsessionrc: makes Debian play nice with ThinkPads and their nipple mice.

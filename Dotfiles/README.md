# Dotfiles

The dotfiles part of the dotfiles repo

- `.aliases`:       Because screw having to write things in full
- `.bash_profile`:  Sources most of the rest of these, as well as setting some options
- `.bashrc`:        At the moment, just sources `.bash_profile`, for compatibility
- `.exports`:       Sets some more options in the form of telling Terminals where to looks for things
- `.functions`:     Some useful Terminal things that are a bit more involved than just aliases
- `.gitconfig`:     Automatically set up git how I like it on new systems
- `.gitignore`:     Ignoring useless files to keep all this tidy
- `.inputrc`:       More useful Terminal options
- `.prompt`:        Makes my prompt look all pretty
- `.vimrc`:         Vim is my text editor of choice, this tells it how to be
- `.xsessionrc`:    Makes Debian play nice with ThinkPad Nipple Mice (TrackPoints if you wanna be uptight)
